# Efficiencies of Right-Sizing Tests
This exercise is meant to give you a practical example on how the number of inputs to a test affect the number of tests you need to write and maintain in order to fully cover your system.


## The Assignment
When they are sold, diamonds of the same carat are priced based on clarity, cut and color. Pretty Coal Diamonds sets their price based on the prices of diamonds worldwide. They have access to a worldwide system that records information about every diamond sold. Sometimes the price of a diamond is missing. In order for the missing price to not skew their data, Pretty Coal Diamonds fills in that field with the average price of a diamond of the same clarity, cut and color for that day.

The piece of code that imputes the average price is in the src directory. Your task is to test it providing all possible values for each variable that affects the price.

### File Structure
